This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Stephanie, your general strength in this course in this semester is "effectively communicate programming solutions to others", and your room to improve is "identify/characterize/define a programming problem ". Stephanie, I really appreciate how you always engage with the class actively. You always help your classmates to solve problems and you are always open to share your own solutions.You work really hard everyday and always turn in very excellent homework. You have achieved an overall grade of 100% for your afterschool assignments.

Stephanie, you did well learning the skills in this class. Your grade in Unit 1 was A. Your grade was A for the last unit. My suggestion for you is to be free to ask more questions both in class and after class. Even solving small confusions will help you improve your understanding significantly.Your semester grade is A. Excellent work! I really enjoyed teaching you!

Stephanie I don't even know why you are in this class. It seems like you are another teacher helping other students rather than making mistakes and learning yourself.
