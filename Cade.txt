This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Cade, your general strength in this course in this semester is "express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts", and your room to improve is "effectively communicate programming solutions to others". Cade, I really appreciate how you always engage with the class actively. You always help your classmates to solve problems and you are always open to share your own solutions.You have put effort into our daily assignments, but there is still a big room for improvements. You only have an overall grade of 32% for your afterschool assignments.

Cade, your learning did not improve significantly in this semester. Your grade in Unit 1 was C, and in the end you only got F for the last unit. I think you should pay more time and effort on the classwork afterschool. You should also spend more time reflecting your area for improvements, and meet with either me as the teacher or other classmates to ask questions. Your semester grade is F. I'm looking forward to teaching you next year and see your improvements!

You are certainly a pleasure to have in class. However it may be within our best interests to find more time to talk one on one just so I can help you understand the concepts much better.
