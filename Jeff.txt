This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Jeff, your general strength in this course in this semester is "design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems", and your room to improve is "understand and be able to use a variety of data types, control structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in their programming". Jeff, I really appreciate how you always engage with the class actively. You always help your classmates to solve problems and you are always open to share your own solutions.You have put effort into our daily assignments, but there is still a big room for improvements. You only have an overall grade of 55% for your afterschool assignments.

Jeff, you did well learning the skills in this class. Your grade in Unit 1 was C. Your grade was C+ for the last unit. My suggestion for you is to be free to ask more questions both in class and after class. Even solving small confusions will help you improve your understanding significantly.Your semester grade is D. Please work harder! You can do it!

 Nice Job!
