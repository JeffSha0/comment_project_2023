This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Matt, your general strength in this course in this semester is "identify/characterize/define a programming problem ", and your room to improve is "work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects". Matt, you rarely come to class on time, and seem to be never following our learning.You have put effort into our daily assignments, but there is still a big room for improvements. You only have an overall grade of 64% for your afterschool assignments.

Matt, your learning did not improve significantly in this semester. Your grade in Unit 1 was C+, and in the end you only got D+ for the last unit. I think you should pay more time and effort on the classwork afterschool. You should also spend more time reflecting your area for improvements, and meet with either me as the teacher or other classmates to ask questions. Your semester grade is C. Put more effort on your weaknesses and I believe you can have great improvement!
