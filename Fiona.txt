This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Fiona, your general strength in this course in this semester is "work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects", and your room to improve is "design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems". Fiona, I really appreciate how you always engage with the class actively. You always help your classmates to solve problems and you are always open to share your own solutions.You work actively after class and always give me your high-quality answers of problem sets. You have achieved an overall grade of 82% for your afterschool assignments.

Fiona, your learning did not improve significantly in this semester. Your grade in Unit 1 was A-, and in the end you only got B+ for the last unit. I think you should pay more time and effort on the classwork afterschool. You should also spend more time reflecting your area for improvements, and meet with either me as the teacher or other classmates to ask questions. Your semester grade is B. Very solid work, nice job!
