This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Riley, your general strength in this course in this semester is "understand and be able to use a variety of data types, control structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in their programming", and your room to improve is "express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts". Riley, I really appreciate how you always engage with the class actively. You always help your classmates to solve problems and you are always open to share your own solutions.You work really hard everyday and always turn in very excellent homework. You have achieved an overall grade of 88% for your afterschool assignments.

You reflected your personal area for growth after each unit accurately, which is a really useful key to enhance your learning.Your semester grade is A-. Excellent work! I really enjoyed teaching you!

You are such a great student to have in class. You always brighten up the mood with jokes that don't interrupt my lessons.
