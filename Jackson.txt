This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Jackson, your general strength in this course in this semester is "design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems", and your room to improve is "express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts". Jackson, you participate in class solidly. You have very progressive work everyday in class.You work actively after class and always give me your high-quality answers of problem sets. You have achieved an overall grade of 75% for your afterschool assignments.

Jackson, you did well learning the skills in this class. Your grade in Unit 1 was B. Your grade was B+ for the last unit. My suggestion for you is to be free to ask more questions both in class and after class. Even solving small confusions will help you improve your understanding significantly.Your semester grade is B. Very solid work, nice job!
