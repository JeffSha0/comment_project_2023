This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.

Chloe, your general strength in this course in this semester is "identify and repair coding errors in a program", and your room to improve is "design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems". Chloe, you rarely come to class on time, and seem to be never following our learning.You work really hard everyday and always turn in very excellent homework. You have achieved an overall grade of 89% for your afterschool assignments.

Chloe, your learning did not improve significantly in this semester. Your grade in Unit 1 was A, and in the end you only got B+ for the last unit. I think you should pay more time and effort on the classwork afterschool. You should also spend more time reflecting your area for improvements, and meet with either me as the teacher or other classmates to ask questions. Your semester grade is B+. Very solid work, nice job!
